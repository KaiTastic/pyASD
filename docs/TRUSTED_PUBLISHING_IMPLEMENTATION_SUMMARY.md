## 🎓 Key Concepts Explained

### What is Trusted Publishing?

Trusted Publishing (OIDC-based authentication) allows GitHub Actions to publish to PyPI without long-lived API tokens. Instead, GitHub generates short-lived tokens that PyPI verifies against configured publishers.

### How It Works

```
GitHub Actions Workflow
  ↓
Requests OIDC token with claims:
  - repository: KaiTastic/pyASDReader
  - workflow: publish-to-pypi.yml
  - environment: pypi-production
  ↓
PyPI receives token
  ↓
Verifies claims match configured Trusted Publisher
  ↓
Authorizes package upload
```

### Why Configuration Must Match Exactly

PyPI compares the token claims with the Trusted Publisher configuration. **Any mismatch fails the verification**:

- ❌ `pyASDReader` != `ASD_File_Reader`
- ❌ `publish-to-pypi.yml` != `.github/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml`
- ❌ `pypi-production` != `production`
- ❌ `KaiTastic` != `kaitastic`

## 🔍 Diagnostic Tools Matrix

| Tool | Purpose | Usage | Output |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| **test_environment_setup.sh** | Verify GitHub Environment | `bash scripts/test_environment_setup.sh` | Environment status, reviewers, branches |
| **diagnose_trusted_publishing.sh** | Check full configuration | `bash scripts/diagnose_trusted_publishing.sh` | Workflow config, env status, PyPI requirements |
| **debug-trusted-publishing.yml** | Print OIDC token claims | `gh workflow run debug-trusted-publishing.yml` | Token claims, config requirements, reachability |

## 📝 Notes

### Why Configuration Can't Be Automated

PyPI requires **manual** Trusted Publisher configuration through their web interface. This is intentional for security:
- Prevents unauthorized automation
- Requires human verification
- Ensures account owner approval

### Repository Name Ambiguity

The repository directory name is `ASD_File_Reader`, but:
- GitHub repository name is `pyASDReader`
- Package name on PyPI is `pyASDReader`
- **Must use `pyASDReader` in Trusted Publisher config**

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete solution for Trusted Publishing configuration and troubleshooting. All tools and documentation are now in place for the user to successfully configure and use Trusted Publishing for automated PyPI releases.

**Next Step**: User must manually configure PyPI and TestPyPI Trusted Publishers using the provided guides.
